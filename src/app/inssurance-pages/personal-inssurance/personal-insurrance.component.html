            Every automobile owner in Quebec must have at least liability insurance to cover damages caused by your fault to another person. This is often referred to as “one-side” insurance (Chapter A).
            Optional private insurance (Chapter B) covers damages to your vehicle resulting from a collision for which you are responsible. It can also cover fire, theft, and vandalism.

            Motorcycle insurance in Quebec is essential for motorcycle owners, offering protection against specific risks associated with riding motorcycles. Here are the key points to know:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Liability Insurance:</strong> Mandatory like for cars, it covers bodily injury and property damage caused to others in an accident for which you are responsible.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Collision Insurance:</strong> Also optional, it covers damages to your motorcycle resulting from a collision with another vehicle or a stationary object, regardless of who is at fault.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist Coverage:</strong> Protects against damages caused by drivers who are not adequately insured or not insured at all.
